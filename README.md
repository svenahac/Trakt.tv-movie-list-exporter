<h1> Trakt.tv movie list exporter</h1>
<p>Trakt.tv allows you to export movies as a .csv file if you purchase their VIP plan. I don't have money so i made a scuffed program that does the same thing but for free.<p>

<h2>Before running the program open your terminal and write:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>pip install beautifulsoup4</li>
  <li>pip install requests</li>
</ul>

<h3>Choose your version</h3>
<p>You can export the movies as .csv or as .txt files. The downside of the .txt output is that it is significantly slower.<p>
